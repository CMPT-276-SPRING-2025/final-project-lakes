## Project Description

This project is an AI-powered platform designed to help job seekers improve their resumes, generate tailored cover letters, and find job opportunities that best match their skills and experience. By leveraging AI and job search APIs, the application streamlines the job application process, providing personalized feedback, keyword optimization, and job matching to enhance applicant tracking system (ATS) compatibility.

The platform uses the OpenAI API to analyze resumes, generate insightful feedback, and suggest improvements. Users can upload their resume and receive a score along with actionable recommendations to refine their content. Additionally, the AI-powered cover letter generator creates tailored cover letters based on job descriptions, ensuring a strong alignment between applications and employer expectations. The system also extracts keywords from job postings and suggests enhancements to increase the chances of passing ATS filters.

To assist users in finding the right job, HireWise integrates with the LinkedIn Jobs API (or an alternative job search API) to provide relevant job listings based on role and location. The job matching system analyzes the user's resume and suggests the most suitable job postings. Additionally, users can access valuable insights on companies, including culture, reviews, and hiring trends, helping them make informed decisions before applying.

With a clean and intuitive UI built using ShadCN UI, HireWise makes the job search and application process more efficient, enabling users to create optimized resumes, apply for relevant roles, and boost their chances of landing their ideal job. ðŸš€
